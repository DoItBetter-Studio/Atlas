# Atlas

> Proprietary Software — DoItBetter Studio

**Atlas** is a core component of the Glyphborn engine ecosystem.

Development began in August 2025 as part of a long-term effort to build a modular, deterministic game engine and editor suite.

---

## Overview

Atlas is responsible for:

- [Primary responsibility 1]
- [Primary responsibility 2]
- [Primary responsibility 3]
- [Primary responsibility 4]

It defines and manages a specific domain within the engine architecture while remaining decoupled from presentation and runtime systems.

---

## Architectural Role

The Glyphborn ecosystem is intentionally modular.

Atlas handles:

✔ [Core domain handled]

Atlas does **not** handle:

✖ Rendering  
✖ Audio (unless this is Echo)  
✖ Game rules  
✖ Networking  
✖ UI  

This separation ensures long-term maintainability, scalability, and clean dependency boundaries.

---

## Design Principles

All DoItBetter Studio engine tools follow these principles:

- **Deterministic Behavior**  
- **Engine-Agnostic Core Logic**  
- **Strict Separation of Concerns**  
- **Modular Versioning**  
- **Testability First**  

---

## Ecosystem Integration

Atlas integrates with:

- Atlas — World & spatial systems  
- Echo — Audio systems  
- Mapper — Tooling & editor workflows  
- Glyphborn — Core runtime  

These components are developed as independent repositories to support isolated updates and long-term maintainability.

---

## Project Status

This project is currently in active development.

The Glyphborn engine will eventually be rebranded and released as:

**Damascus — The Steel Editor Suite**

Until official release, this repository is publicly visible for transparency and portfolio purposes but is not open source.
